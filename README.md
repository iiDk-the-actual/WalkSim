# Description

**Walk Simulator** is a mod for Gorilla Tag, originally created by KyleTheScientist, used to simulate playing the game on a VR headset while still being on PC. It's been used for years by developers and users to test things out without getting on their headset. Though, over that time span, there has somehow never been an official GitHub repository for the mod. So, I've decompiled the original DLL and cleaned it up for public viewing.

## Some changes include:
- Ability to get out of the simulator by not selecting an icon
- Fixed for later updates
- Fixed icon placement
- Fixed computer
- Adjustable height, fly speed

# Installation

- Download the release from [here](https://github.com/iiDk-the-actual/NameTags/releases/latest)
- Drag the file `NameTags.dll` to your plugins folder
- Start Gorilla Tag if needed
